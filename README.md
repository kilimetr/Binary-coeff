# Binary-coeff

Evaluating binary coeffs for two components (biphenyl and benzoic acid) with using knowledge that the second virial coeff equals to the binary coeff of pure component.
Acentric factor is calculated with using Edmister's method.
For polar components mixing binary coeff (deltaB) is good to be evaluated.
